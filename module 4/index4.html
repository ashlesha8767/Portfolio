        <h2>Introduction to 3D Printing</h2>
        <ul><li>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file</li><br>
        <li>It works by adding material layer by layer until the object is formed, unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods where material is removed from a block.</li><br>
        <li>3D printing is technology that has gained significant traction in various fields over the past few years. It works by creating three-dimensional objects layer by layer from a digital file, using materials such as plastics, metals, ceramics, and even organic materials like food or living cells. <br>
            <li> 3D printing begins with creating a digital model of the object using computer-aided design (CAD) software or by 3D scanning an existing object. The digital model is then sliced into thin horizontal layers by slicing software, and the 3D printer builds the object layer by layer, following the instructions from the sliced file.  </li> <br>
             <li>There are several types of 3D printing technologies, including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), and Electron Beam Melting (EBM). Each technology has its advantages and limitations in terms of resolution, speed, material compatibility, and cost.</li>

        <h2>Types of 3D Printing Technologies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): Most common type, where thermoplastic filaments are melted and extruded through a nozzle.</li>
            <li>Stereolithography (SLA): Uses a UV laser to cure liquid resin into solid layers.</li>
            <li>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Utilizes a laser to sinter powdered material, such as metal or nylon, into solid layers.</li>
       <li>Digital Light Processing (DLP): Similar to SLA but uses a digital light projector to cure resin.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Applications:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prototyping: One of the earliest and still most prevalent uses of 3D printing is rapid prototyping, enabling designers to quickly iterate on designs.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing: 3D printing is increasingly used in small-scale manufacturing for customized or low-volume production.</li>
        <li>Medicine and Healthcare: From prosthetics to surgical tools to personalized implants, 3D printing is revolutionizing healthcare. </li>
   <li>Education: It's used in schools and universities to teach design, engineering, and manufacturing concepts</li>
    </ul>
